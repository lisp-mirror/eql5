REBUILD STEPS (on every upgrade of: ECL, Qt, EQL)
=============

Change to eql/src/ and do:

1) remove directory tmp/
   remove slime/thread-safe.fas*
   remove src/lisp/ecl-readline.fas* (only on upgrading ECL; to recompile manually)

2) ecl -shell make-eql-lib.lisp

3) qmake, make in this order: (MSVC: nmake; use qmake-qt4 if you have Qt5 installed)

    eql_lib.pro
    eql_exe.pro

    module_network.pro
    module_...

Optionally (integrate wrapper functions):

4) eql5 make-eql-lib-wrappers.lisp

5) re-link EQL library:

    touch tmp/eql.o    (or delete "tmp/eql.o*")
    qmake eql_lib.pro
    make


IMPORTANT NOTES
===============

C++:

You always need to rebuild from any "*.pro" file (EQL modules, Qt_EQL...) after
upgrading EQL.

The simplest way to clean everything is to remove the whole "tmp/" directory in
the respective build directory, since the Makefile generated by Qt not always
works correctly with "make clean" (e.g. on Windows).

Lisp:

It's also recommended to recompile any compiled EQL code (because of the tight
ECL/C++ integration).


TIP
===

If you're on Linux, see "src/rebuild".
