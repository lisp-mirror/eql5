  eql palindrome 400 8/10 # optionally pass width / opacity


HTML VERSION
============

Since this is a relatively complex application, it would be
convenient to generate a 'lazy' (pre-calculated) Html5 version,
using the <canvas> element and JS.

Use command line option :html to have it generated:

  eql palindrome.lisp :html

(optionally pass the width, which defaults to 450)
