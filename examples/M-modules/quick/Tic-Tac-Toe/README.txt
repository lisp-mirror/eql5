This is a port of a QtQuick1/Qt4 example.

The JS game logic has (obviously) been ported to Lisp, see "game-logic.lisp".


RUN
===

Please run it from this directory.

For Emacs/Slime, this would be:

    eql5 ~/slime/eql-start-swank.lisp tic-tac-toe


CALL LISP
=========

Examples:

    Lisp.call("cl:foo", x, y)
    Lisp.call(this, "cl:foo", x, y)    ; optionally pass 'this'

    Lisp.apply("cl:foo", [x, y])
    Lisp.apply(this, "cl:foo", [x, y]) ; see above

'this' can be accessed in Lisp through qml:*caller*


QML FILES
=========

Always add these 2 "import" lines for Lisp access:

    import EQL5 1.0
    import "qrc:///eql5.js" as Lisp

The "eql5.js" file is compiled as a resource into the eql5 shared library,
see "eql5/src/eql5.js" and "eql5/src/eql5.qrc".


NOTES
=====

Try the following:

    (qml-set "game" "difficulty" 8) ; one of: 2, 8, 10

Since the logic of the buttons is defined in the QML file, changes to
properties will be reflected immediately by the UI.

Anywhere an 'objectName' is expected, you can optionally pass a QQuickItem
directly, or NIL if you want to use the root item.

Please see also "../qml-lisp/qml/example.lisp" for documentation on calling
Lisp functions from QML.


TIP
===

In order to have uniform access to QQuickItems from both QML and Lisp
functions, it is convenient to set both 'id:' and 'objectName:' to the
same name.

QML Example:

    Item {
        id: myItem
        objectName: "myItem"
    }
