If you are new to QML/EQL5, you probably want to go through the examples
(and READMEs) in this order:

    * qml-lisp
    * Tic-Tac-Toe
    * item-model
    * painted-item

The trivial "quickwidget" example just demonstrates that you can integrate
a QML widget in any Qt application, combining both traditional Qt and QML.
