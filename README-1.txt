BUILD (for the impatient)
=====

In src/ do:

  ecl -shell make
  qmake eql5.pro     (comment out all modules you don't need)
  make
  sudo make install  (Unix only)

Now you should be able to exec 'eql5'.

If there are problems, or you want more info, see detailed instructions below.



TESTED WITH
===========

  Linux (development platform), with both gcc and clang:
    ECL 16.1.2
    Qt 5.5.1 (with module 'webkit')
    Qt 5.8   (with module 'webengine')

  Windows:
    MSVC 2010, MinGW 4.9*:
    ECL git 2017-02 / 32 bit
    Qt 5.5.1 / 32 bit (precompiled from qt.io archives; contains WebKit)

    MSVC 2015
    ECL git 2016-11 / 64 bit (see flag in Makefile)
    Qt 5.7 / 64 bit (precompiled from qt.io archives; WebKit is not included)

  OSX:
    not tested personally, but has been reported to work (with clang)

  ---

  *) to successfully build with MinGW, I needed to:
     - change a typedef in "ecl.h" (after building ECL); see compile error;
     - comment out all offending lines of module :quick; see SGTexture related
       linker errors; the source files are in "eql5/src/gen/quick/";


REQUIREMENTS
============

  * ECL threads + unicode
  * Qt >= 5.5
  * /should/ run cross-platform

  QtWebKit note:
    If you want QtWebKit included in the official downloads from qt.io archives,
    you need to choose Qt 5.5, and not later versions!
    QtWebKit will continue to work with versions > 5.5, but it has to be
    compiled manually (which is not fun).
    QtWebKit has a better, more native integration with Qt than QtWebEngine, see
    for example QWebElement, which doesn't exist in QtWebEngine.



PREPARE
=======

Install the ECL sources, and build it from the sources (ECL needs to be built
with the same compiler you'll use to compile EQL5).

Just use the standard configuration of ECL (both threads & unicode enabled).

Qt4/Qt5 note:

  You can have both old EQL (Qt4) and EQL5 (Qt5) installed in parallel (exe and
  lib names differ).

  If you have both Qt4 and Qt5 installed, you can use the following environment
  variable to switch between the both (Unix):

    export QT_SELECT=5

Please note that you need to build EQL5 in a path where you will keep it (you
can't move around the whole file tree later, since the build path needs to be
hard-coded in the executable).



BUILD
=====

(N.B. for rebuilding, please see README-2-REBUILD.txt)

  [Windows]
    You first need to adapt the file 'src/windows.pri' (include & library
    paths).
    Since EQL requires the C compiler anyway (not the bytecode compiler), you
    should put this line in your '~/.eclrc':
        (require :cmp)
    
  [MSVC]
    Substitute make with nmake.

  [MinGW]
    If 'make' is stuck in an infinite loop of creating the 'Makefile', just
    remove the line 'include(windows.pri)' from your '*.pro' file, setting
    eventually needed paths in your '~/.profile' instead.

  [OSX]
    To force creation of a Makefile (instead of an Xcode project), use this
    flag:
        qmake -spec macx-g++

1) Change to src/ and run:

    ecl -shell make.lisp

2) Edit 'eql5.pro' and comment out all modules you don't need (see comment).
   Then run:

    qmake eql5.pro
    make
    sudo make install  (Unix only)

   This will build the executable, the shared library and the modules.

   If you ran "make install", you'll find the installed files here:

       /usr/local/bin/
       /usr/local/lib/
       /usr/local/include/eql5/

3) cd ..

  [Linux]
    N.B. skip this if you did "sudo make install"

    You need to create links to EQL, something like (note the "5"):
        cd /usr/lib
        sudo ln -s ~/eql5/libeql5.so.1 libeql5.so.1
        cd /usr/bin
        sudo ln -s ~/eql5/eql5 eql5

  [OSX]
    N.B. skip this if you did "sudo make install"

    You need to create links to EQL, something like (note the "5"):
        cd /usr/local/lib
        sudo ln -s ~/eql5/libeql5.1.dylib libeql5.1.dylib
        cd /usr/local/bin
        sudo ln -s ~/eql5/eql5.app/Contents/MacOS/eql5 eql5

  [Windows]
    Add your EQL directory to the Path environment variable, see:
    <Control Panel:System:Advanced:Environment Variables>



RUN
===

You can run a simple interactive REPL UI doing:
    eql5 -qgui

To run a Lisp file without top-level, do:
    eql5 examples/2-clock

(If you don't see the application window, it might be in the background.
Use your taskbar to show it.)

If you start the EQL executable without arguments, it will start the usual ECL
top-level (without processing Qt events).

To _not_ load ~/.eclrc on startup, do:
    eql5 -norc

To quit the tool, do:
    (eql:qquit) or
    (eql:qq)

In order to run (sort of) a top-level processing Qt events, do:
    eql5 -qtpl

    Note: If you want to use "ecl-readline" together with "-qtpl", just compile
          "lib/ecl-readline.lisp" (which depends on the "readline" C library).
          It will then be loaded automatically on startup:

              cd ~/eql5/lib
              ecl -compile ecl-readline.lisp

          N.B: Using readline, you will often need to "reset" (command) your
               console/shell after EQL finished working, especially during
               development time or other exits than "(eql:qquit)".



QT MODULES (help, multimedia, network, quick, sql, svg, webengine, webkit)
==========

N.B. skip this if you already built from 'eql5.pro' (see above)

  To build an EQL module (corresponding to a Qt module), do the following in
  src/:

    qmake module_<name>.pro (e.g. qmake module_network.pro)
    make
    sudo make install       (unix only)

    [Linux,OSX]
      (N.B. skip this if you did "sudo make install")
      You need to create links to the modules, see EQL library above.

In Lisp, use function QREQUIRE to load a module:

    (qrequire :network)



TIPS
====

You might want to put this in your ~/.eclrc file:

    #+eql
    (setf eql:*qtpl*            t  ; same as -qtpl
          eql:*break-on-errors* t)

It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to integrate the wrapper functions, see
README-3-OPTIONAL.
This will make all Qt functions real Lisp functions, which also means symbol
tab-completion, both in Emacs/Slime and with ecl-readline.

DISCLAIMER
==========

Clicking around on "gitlab.com" will eventually bring to your attention a chart
with the "used languages".

I just wanted to clearify that 0.0000000% of "NewLisp" (whatever that means) is
used in this project (a simple and obvious mis-identification).
