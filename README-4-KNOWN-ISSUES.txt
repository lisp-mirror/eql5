After using QFileDialog, you may experience an infinite error message loop when quitting EQL.
The SIGSEGV happens in QIcon::~QIcon(), and is therefore neither the fault of ECL nor EQL.
(It seems to be related to Gtk/Themes.)

A drastic measure against this annoying behaviour is calling "abort()" instead of "exit()" by using:
  
  (eql:qquit -1) ; negative exit status

which would be :abort or :qa directly on the top-level.
